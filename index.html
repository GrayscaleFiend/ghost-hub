	Welcome to the site!
	</h1>
	<p> I'm using this website assignment as a chance to work on a website for a personal project, having to do with computer mascots.

	What's an Ukagaka/Ghost?
	</h2>
	<p> An Ukagaka, or ghost, is a computer mascot that can talk to you, manage a calendar, take out your recycling bin, and much more! Some can also interact with each other.
	They run on the baseware SSP (Sakurascript Player) and originated as a Japanese program which can be downloaded on the left sidebar of this website here: <a href = "http://ssp.shillest.net/">ssp.shillest.net</a>.
	The English community for ghosts has grown a lot over the years, but is popular for its relation to the game Undertale by the ghosts inspired by it below:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Gaster by Zarla</li>
		<li>MVSans by Excel_Lynt</li>
		<li>Underfell Sans by Change</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	Personally, I have been working on ghosts myself, one by myself and two collaborative efforts:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Gel</li>
		<li>Zaiga (with nasaalving)</li>
		<li>Nox (with dransnake)</li>
	</ol>
