	What's an Ukagaka/Ghost?
	</h2>
	<p> An Ukagaka, or ghost, is a computer mascot that can talk to you, manage a calendar, take out your recycling bin, and much more! Some can also interact with each other.
	They run on the baseware SSP (Sakurascript Player) and originated as a Japanese program which can be downloaded on the left sidebar of this website here: <a href = "http://ssp.shillest.net/">ssp.shillest.net</a>.
